 # API documentation

 This project is a framework to generate REST API, the user documentation has to be considered.

 One way to generate and publish the user documentation is to use Swagger. https://app.swaggerhub.com/

 This tool provides a graphical editor and a way to publish the documentation. It is based on a textual description that should be easy to generate from metadata and a template.

 By default public APIs can be accessed through a a public URL
 https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/flub78/todoList/1.0.0#/

 The geting started documentation https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub/getting-started/

 Two approaches:
 * Design first, the documentation is written before the code.
 * Code first, in this case it is possible to import existing APIs.

There is a tool to convert json to swagger snippets: https://roger13.github.io/SwagDefGen/

And the documentation reference: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/
